# Day 10

It's great to know that every Wednesday I won't have classes so I can really use it to make some progress in web development.

Today I start to see how you can make a responsive site, it's a little bit confusing but not too much so in a few days or weeks I hope to dominate this part.

Tomorrow I'll be completing this page and seeing how to make other parts of the page responsive!
