#Day 104

And here is my final project, I thought I could not make much progress but in the end I managed to make a very good progress.
I'm having several problems with the libraries, since there are some that changed the name of certain functions.
I only need to implement neural networks. Obviously I could not do this without the tensorflow library, it takes away too much work.
I hope it does not take more than a few days.
