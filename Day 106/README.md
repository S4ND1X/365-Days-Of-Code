#Day 106
Today I started the first Hackathon of the week.
Today we focused on preparing the first advance we have to deliver tomorrow before 9pm. It is mainly to explain our idea and what we want to do.
I was in charge of writing the intents so that the algorithm could work and fortunately it did.
I will not upload anything from the hackathon until I finish it, so I did a very quick CodeSignals exercise.
