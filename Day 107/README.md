#Day 107

The hackathon is already two days away, right now we are waiting for the results to know if we go to the second phase.
As I still can not publish anything of our project, I started to solve a fairly simple exercise of CodeSignals, but I needed to publish something today, without taking much time to continue doing our Hackaton project.
