# Day 10

Today I made some advance, mainly in the design part but tomorrow I'll be finishing this page and make it responsive

I'm planning to start learning some basics of ML so I can have two topics to upload If one day I don't feel like to practice web development.

That's it for today and let's see tomorrow.
