#Day 119
It was a very interesting day.
I decided to start solving all the competitive programming exercises in CodeForces.
Since they are the most similar to those of large competitions.
I made three of the easiest of the platform just to understand its system of inputs and outputs.
It was quite curious that you have to upload your file and specify the language version.
I would like to mention three things:
1- I will try to start using scanf and printf since I have read in certain forums that it is better to do it in that a way instead of using Cin and Cout.
2- While I was doing the problems I had several doubts about the operation of the most basic elements of syntax and how they work and looking online I saw some tests with Cin, ScanF to see which method was faster and ScanF is much faster, but then I saw that they did a test with (Cin and ios::sync_with_stdio (false)) and it was even faster than ScanF. Although using this line of code is not exactly for optimization and has many points against using it. For more info I will leave this link in which this is better explained.

3-Thanks to a friend I discovered the macros in C ++ that are basically ways to use recurring functions in your program, example => for, although I have not yet investigated how good it is to use them, especially if it is a convention or not.

I will try to put these points into practice in the following problems that I solve, but now that I know how CodeForces works, I will choose problems of greater difficulty.

I was really impressed by the things I could learn by solving simple problems, maybe they are not very important but learning these little details of syntax really amuses me.
