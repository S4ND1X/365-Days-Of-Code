# Day 13

It sounds crazy but processing data is lowkey funny, I mean I think that in just 2 days I learned a lot of methods on how to preprocess data.
Of course, I don't know exactly how to implement them but is good to know that they exist.

Currently I'm working on spyder and Rstudio, it's kind of messy because there is a little bit different syntaxis but is fun!
