#Day 131    
Today I went back to the DataScience course.
Right now I'm still on how to manipulate files, but this time from an external url and pass the binary string I received and transform it into a dictionary to use the DataFrame function that provides Pandas and be able to manipulate the data correctly.
I will try to advance this course on my own without publishing my advances, since I do not want to saturate this topic. Then I will be uploading on different days about, Competitive Programming, Web Development, Unity and data science from time to time.
