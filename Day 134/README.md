#Day 134

Today I wanted to go back to C ++ to train a couple of things.
I realized that I had never done sorting algorithms in C ++ so I decided to do them to refresh everything.
Despite of not being algorithms so complicated to program, they served me to regain a little fluency.
Tomorrow I will continue doing exercises in C ++ so when I reach the subjects of data structures I have no problems with syntax and others.
