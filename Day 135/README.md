#Day 135
Today I learned more about Struct. It is similar to a class and you can really use them for the same although it is preferable to use struct when you are not going to have functions.
Here basically I just have a nested struct and then I make an array of that type of struct.
Tomorrow I will start to see templates for functions.
I also finished doing some types of search that is the sequential search and binary search. They are not difficult but I liked the use of flags since I almost did not use them. I mean I use them but I never really call them flags.
