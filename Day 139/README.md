#Day 139


I'm learning the basics of memory management.
Today I learned how to create a dynamic array, this consists of reserving the necessary bytes for your array and assigning the values ​​in your array using memory adress.
Later when you stop using your array, with the keyword Delete you delete the space you had reserved for that memory so you will not be saturating the ram.
