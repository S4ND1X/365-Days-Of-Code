# Day 14

Today I finished this section about flexbox, I still have a lot of things to learn but I feel that it's a good start.

Also, I'm still learning how to process data an all those concepts, so I'm very excited because I would have plenty topics to choose from!

Tomorrow I think that I will do more things about data or maybe try to do something in python!
