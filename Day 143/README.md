#Day 143

I did not upload anything yesterday night, because together with some friends, we decided to organize our own mini hackaton, at the beginning we wanted to do something related to hacking but due to the internet we could not really do anything so in the end we decided to organize our own contest competitive programming in hackerrank.
The truth that we are dead because having to think at 5 a.m is quite complicated but in the end we managed to make a few problems.
Here is the link of the tournament in case someone is interested.
