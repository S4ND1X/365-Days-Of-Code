#Day 144

Today, despite being very tired of the mini-hackathon I did with my friends, I wanted to do something different so I started to see the beginnings of web scraping in python. I really did not know how complicated it would be but at least the beginnings are not difficult. What I feel may be confusing is the fact that if you do not know how to read html, it will be very difficult to be able to access the parts you need from the page. But other than that, getting information from a page using python is relatively simple!
