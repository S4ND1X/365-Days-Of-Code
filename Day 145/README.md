#Day 145

Today I decided to start with a random project that is Conway's Game Of Life. I had seen how it worked before and the truth was that I wanted to try to do it.
I'm currently doing it with python and the PyGame library. I'm just starting to draw everything to the screen and so on, I hope tomorrow and can begin to program the rules of death and life.
