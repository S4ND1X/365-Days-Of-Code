#Day 147
Today, I started a routine to prepare for the next ICPC date. Together with some friends, we will be solving between 4 and 6 CodeForces problems a day.
We will start with all of the 800 points and so on for 4 months to reach the 1300 points.
The objective is to prepare us very well for the competition and we will be practicing for interview exercises and improving our way of programming in general.
All this we will do in C ++.
