# Day 15

I make some progress in ML, I learned how to encode data so we can use it in formulas later on.
It's very easy to enconde this things, at least in this dataset but It's really great to know this.

This week I will start a project with a friend, to develope an app by making use of twiter api.
We really want to make it the most professionally possible so we can learn a lot in the process.
I'll uploading some content about that but I won't stop learning Html, Css, etc... and Ml
