#Day 156
I decided to start making a game in Java.
Since one of the languages ​​that I will be learning the next semester is Java, I decided to give myself a refreshed to the language to arrive without problems.
My plan is to make a game inspired by a board game that I saw on the internet.
We'll see how it goes.
