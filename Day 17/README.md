# Day 17

I was able to fix the problem, It was something very stupid but I didn't think about it before.
The problem was that twitter's api only works with python 3.6 and I had installed 3.7 Sooo... yeah.
But at least I fixed it, and tomorrow I will be able to start getting the tweets and do something with them.
