# Day 19

Finally, the tweets are printing!

I was using the wrong libraries, also you can say how many tweets you want and from any user you want.
I also implement the function to add each tweet to a csv, so later, we can use them in other scripts.
Tomorrow I will "clean" the tweet so I get only the info that I need.
