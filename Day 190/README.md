#Day 190
Today was quite productive.
I started a new project in Unity, it's a basic Block Breaker but I want to recover that fluency that I had, besides that I worked for a while on the web page for consulting movies.
I managed to do the Fecth to the API and receive the data, tomorrow I will be working on how to deploy them.
By the way I made some changes to my code editor, installing several sources and personalizing it a bit and I've never been happier with it.
