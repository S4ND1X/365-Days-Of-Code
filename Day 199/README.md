#Day 199

Today I focus a lot on the spawning system of the enemies and that they can follow a path, in addition to that I already started to program the damage done by the bullets.
I also have several secondary projects to hire, going up little by little, such as learning to develop applications in Android Studio, which I have been doing for about a month in addition to other 3D games that I do not want to reveal until I have something more complete.
