# Day 2
Hi! Here I am with this second update
Today I learned how to insert audio and video in **html5**, also I learned a lot of different ways to optimize your videos and how to make them compatible with all browser and smartphones.

There are somethings that is good to know like for example, **Chrome doesn’t support autoplay videos without mute them**, same with audios so autoplay audios in chrome is useless, so is good to know these little things!

Also, I finished all the basic forms and put them in a single page, so I can visit the code later when I need a little recap. I’m very excited for everything and this is just the start.

**Autumn is a momentum of the natures golden beauty…, so the same it’s time to find your momentum of life.**
