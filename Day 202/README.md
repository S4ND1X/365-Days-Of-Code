#Day 202

I don't know if I can finish today because I will have to leave my house but the game is almost 90% ready, I just need to display the player's score and life as well as add a start and death menu. Which is quite simple, so if I get back home early, I will finish it. To start with a completely new project tomorrow
Today I managed to finish mainly collisions, sounds, particles and parallax.
