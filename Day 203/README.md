#Day 203

I managed to finish the second game, despite being quite simple. It helped me a lot to clarify concepts as well as to obtain greater fluidity and confidence when using Unity, repeating tasks helps a lot to get that practice.
I realized that I had not uploaded a view of the games, so here are two videos of the games I have made, it is a small part of the complete game but more or less it is the idea behind them. I will start with nothing in 3D development, I already have several prototypes of 3D games that I will upload right here.
