#Day 208

I only had about an hour to code today but at least I managed to do something.
Before I had a lot of problems since I didn't understand the concept of Promise and Then in JS, so I started to investigate and finally I understand it, obviously not 100% but at least quite more than before.
Tomorrow they will start a small vacation that I will take and will last around 5 days so I have the goal of programming all day.
