# Day 21

Today I start learning a little bit of C++, it is very fun!
The syntax it's a little bit weird but there's something about it that I like.

I will be uploading more about web development this week, so I don't forget what I have learned the past few weeks.
I'm enjoying this journey so much, I really want to do this my entire life!
