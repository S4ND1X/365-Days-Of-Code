#Day 211

Today I managed to advance a lot in several aspects.
I managed to finish the mini React project that I was doing and now that I understand the bases a little better, I started with a project that is quite large that I really don't know when I will finish, but it is a page for eCommerce, the objective is to add enough features and Learn more and more.
I also managed to finish the system so that the enemies appear in their respective lanes, in the Plants vs. Zombies type of game that I'm doing.
