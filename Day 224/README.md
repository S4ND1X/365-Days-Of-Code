#Day 224
Today, I spent a lot of time working at Unity. Since there is a week to start Game Jam.
I also did my java homework, I had a few problems especially because of the format since they involved a lot of spaces but in the end I managed to do it, tomorrow I will review the code to see what I can improves.
