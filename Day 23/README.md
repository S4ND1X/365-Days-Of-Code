# Day 23

I couldn’t continue with my app, so I decided to do some c++.

Today I learned a lot of thing (arrays, if statements, etc..) but I think that the most important thing was how to make functions
It’s very easy because I already know how to make functions in other languages so it's not too much deal but it will be very helpful.
