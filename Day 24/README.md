# Day 24

to start practicing for competitive programming.
Right now, I'm also studying python in classes and web development on my own, those are my main goals.

So that's why I learned more of C++ today, but in the next few weeks I will try to practice a lot more, so if anybody has some tips to learn C++, please let me know!
