# Day 25

I decided to upload what I did in my python class.
It is a very simple program, but my teacher wants to see how good my programming conventions are, so I don't know how good I'm in that aspect.
In the other hand, tomorrow I will be continuing with C++, to prepare myself for an upcoming contest.
It's going to be super cool, because sometime in the future I want to code games in Unreal Engine, and you need to know C++.
