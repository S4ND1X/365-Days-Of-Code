# Day 26

Today I finished my programming homework, I was very tired so I couldn't do any of C++.
But tomorrow I will keep learning C++ and go more in depth. 

I really think that my inputs validation is really mess up, I had never done validation before, basically because I'm the one using my programs, so I know what to type in, but at least they work.
