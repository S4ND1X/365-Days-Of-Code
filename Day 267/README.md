#Day 267
Today I had my Microsoft interview so I feel quite sad because I don't know how well it went.
They told me that the result are delivered in 3 weeks so we'll have to wait.
In other news I have to prepare the Unity Workshop that I'll be teaching next week.
So it's time to come back to Game Development.
