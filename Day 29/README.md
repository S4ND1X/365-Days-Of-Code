#Day 29
started to 
practice in CodeSignals, the first exercises are very simple but it's good to recap he python basics
I will be very busy this week with school, so I don't know how much time I will have to code, but I won't fail.
The next week I will have my first exams so I will be studying but after that week I will have time again.
