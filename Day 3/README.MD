# Day 3
Third in a row!

Today was a very exciting day because I start learning **css**. I have to admit that is a little more complicated that what I expected.

I tried to make more things in this page but I decided to understand the basic a little bit more before doing anything else.
The way that you declare what things you want to modify is what confuses me... But with a little practice everythings is possible.

Tomorrow I'll be trying give more detail to the web and also learn all things you can do with text in css.
