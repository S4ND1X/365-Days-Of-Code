#Day 32
I was able to continue with my little game.
Basically, it's like a rock, paper, scissors but with elements.
I love to do this, because I'm able to practice OOP.
What I don't like is that I'm making everything with If Statements and they super messy.
But one friend told me that I can do it with hash tables so tomorrow I will learn how to do it.
