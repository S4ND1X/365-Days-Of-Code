#Day 34
I know it's a little weird that I went back to while and if statements but there is a reason.
I'm trying to use C++ for competitive programming but sometimes I mess up with basic syntax, so I want to return to the basics just to learn them very well.
Also, I want to stop a little bit more in the array section, because a lot of problems are about that, so I really need to understand how they work.
