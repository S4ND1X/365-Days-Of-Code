#Day 355

Today I began to learn an interesting topic, Dynamic Connectivity, I started with the simple, right now it is only to create a method to connect the points through id's but it is not very efficient since to connect N points of N elements, it would take N ^ 2 operations. So tomorrow I will make a more efficient method using the Forest technique which is to implement a tree using Arrays.
