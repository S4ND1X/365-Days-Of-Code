I find it fascinating as with a few simple adjustments, incredible improvements can be made to the algorithms. I learned about weighted and path compression trees. With just a few lines of code, you go from O (n) to O (log * N), this makes the Dynamic Connectivity problem in practice Linear although in theory it is not linear.
