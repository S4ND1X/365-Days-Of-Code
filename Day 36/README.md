#Day 36
I'm starting to do some exercises in Hackerrank so I can practice C++.
This problem was very simple if I use python but in C++ it's a little bit tricky.
In C++ you can't insert items into an array while running, so in order to do that, you need to use a vector. (At least from what I know)
Tomorrow I'll be continuing with these, and one of my goals is to not search how to do it or some kind of cheating.
