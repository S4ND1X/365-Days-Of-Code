#Day 362
Today I solved a very interesting exercise to get the sum of all multiples of 3 and 5 up to 1000. In fact the iterative way is quite simple, but the fun here was to find an analytical way to do it, and here you get This formula, which would be the sum of the multiples of 3 using the Gauss formula, we do the same with the multiples of 5, and then we remove the ones that coincide, that is, the multiples of 15
