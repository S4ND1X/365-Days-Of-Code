#Day 37
I'm continuing with Hackerrank problems.
Today was an interesting, I learned that you can ask this:
cout << array[0] << array[1]
I mean, I don't know if itâ€™s possible in other languages but this simple line help me a lot to complete this program.
Because I was using a for loop, before knowing this.
