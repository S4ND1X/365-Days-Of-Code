#Day 39
Today I start using 2d arrays in C++.
It was a simple algorithm, but I learned a lot.
At the beginning I wanted to use vectors because the size of the matrix wasn't defined, like the previous problems.
But making a matrix with vectors it's a little bit confusing, I mean you also need to know the function from the library <vector>.
But in the problem, it said that the maximum length could be 100 so I decided to define the array with 102.
I guess that it's a waste of memory, I really don't know if it is better to make this or use vectors.
