# Day 4
Today wasn't the best day but here I am.
I didn't have too much time to code, I arrived at my home like 1 hour ago and I'm leaving soon again.
So, I only had like 1 hour to practice some coding but ¡hey, 1 hour is better than nothing! As @codingsami said ¡That's one hour closer to your goal!

In the other hand, tomorrow I'll be able to be in home all day, so I will try to practice and make (I hope) a lot of progress. I want to give some design to this main page as my main goal for this week, at least that it can look decent. I will try to apply all the concepts from **fonts and containers styles**. The only way to really absorb them is by practicing so let's get it!

Stay tuned for tomorrow!!
