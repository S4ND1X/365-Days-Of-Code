#Day 40
I'm very happy with myself because Iâ€™m making at least 2 problems in Hackerrank every day.
I guess that this problem seems easy, but you need to have very clear what you are going to do with every for loop.
Tomorrow I will have all day to code so I'm very excited to see how many problems I can solve.
