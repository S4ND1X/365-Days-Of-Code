#Day 44
I'm very excited to start learning Data Structures.
I'm starting with Linked List, what they are, what they do and how to use them. 
Obviously, it is confusing, but I guess that if a make some exercises, I will be able to understand it better.
Right now, I'm a little confused also with the syntaxis, but in a few days I will be more familiar with it.
