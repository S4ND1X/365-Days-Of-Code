#Day 46
I came back to do some problems, I switched from Hackerrank to OmegaUp but I will be doing exercises from different platforms.
I took some books from the library, one is about Data Structures and the other one is about Algorithms. 
What I want to do is to read and finish them before summer, so I can be practicing all the vacations.
Also, I figured out how to have more time to code, so I will be uploading much more!
