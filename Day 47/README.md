#Day 47
Today I practice a little more pointers with a friend.
Currently I'm trying to understand how pointers work and implement them in my code.
Tomorrow I will be reading my book and trying to make some code in order to understand.
I really want to comprehend this topic because I will need it a lot in C++.
