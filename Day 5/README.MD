# Day 5

Today was a very rewarding day, I practice some properties from containers and I have to say that is a little Stressful.
The problem is that in my mind I want to do something but my css does something completely different and that obviously is because I'm just a beginner.
Basically, my main problems are floats and margins, is very messy to adjust things at the start, but after a while I made my page look more to the way that I wanted.

I really donâ€™t know what I will try to implement tomorrow but maybe I start another page from 0 because the html structure in this one is a little bit messy. 
So, I will try to another page but focusing a lot more in the html, because I found out that a lot of my problems were caused by div in wrong places or awful placements of my tags.

In the final analysis I can say that I learned a lot more from my mistakes. If a code more and make more mistakes I will learn more so that will be my strategies rather than focusing more on watching tutorials and that kind of things.




**I hope that in this year to come, you make mistakes. Because if you are making mistakes, then you are making new things, trying new things, learning, living, pushing yourself, changing yourself, changing your world. You're doing things you've never done before, and more importantly, you're doing something.**
