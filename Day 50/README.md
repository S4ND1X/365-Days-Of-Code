#Day 50
Stacks and more stacks, today I learned how to remove and item from it. 
I still do not feel comfortable with pointers, but I hope that in two weeks I will be capable of at least doing everything by myself.
Tomorrow I'll be continuing with data structures, and the next week I'll be doing web development.
