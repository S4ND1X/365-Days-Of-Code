#Day 51
Today I'm starting with some problems from my data structure book.
What Iâ€™m trying to do is to check that if the parenthesis is balanced, example: 
Balanced: (((()))) Not Balanced: ((((()))
I have done this problem before, but this is my first time doing it with stacks, so it is funny to practice in this way.
At the beginning I wasn't sure about the meaning of "->" in C++ but when I saw that is the "same" thing than this (*p).x;
Everything made senses, tomorrow I'll be finishing this problem.
