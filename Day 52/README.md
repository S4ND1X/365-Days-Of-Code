#Day 52
I really liked this day because I was able to practice my code almost all day.
I did some things about data structure, competitive programming and homework.
This code is from my homework, it was very simple but I must do it so there is no problem.
Tomorrow I'm going to be learning more about data structures and I'm very excited to start practicing web development again next week.
