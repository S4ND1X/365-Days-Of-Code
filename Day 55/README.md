#Day 55
Today I learned the basics of Hash Tables and how to use them.
They are a little confusing but when you know all their advantages, you really want to use them.
Tomorrow I will try to do it in C++, because today I just made a few Hackerrank problems.
This Monday I will start with web development again.
