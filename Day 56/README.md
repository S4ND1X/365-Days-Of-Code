#Day 56
I spent the whole day watching tutorials. And trying to understand Hash Tables.
The way they work isn't difficult, but the implementation, at least from what I know, it is a little confusing.
But I was in the same position with stacks and linked list, and now I understand them.
So, with a little more time, Iâ€™m guessing that I will understand them better.
