#Day 59
I think that this is the last day with Media Queries, because tomorrow I will start making a whole new web page.
I'm going to really focus on this new website and try to remember all the thing that I have learned so far. 
I'm going to use video, audio, flexbox, CSS grid, Media Queries. Also, I'm going to learn JavaScript, MySQL and dive into backend in general.
