# Day 6

Very nice day I would say, I start a little "blog" main page.
Bassically to recap everything that I have learned so far.
Obviously there's more to do but I think that I'll be able to finish tomorrow.

Also I focused a lot more in html structure and be very careful with my tags, 
let's see how it goes tomorrow.
