#Day 60
Today I started the Web page from my Udemy course.
I'm having so much fun, because I'm learning helpful tips. 
I think that I'll be spending at least two weeks on making this website, while at the same time I'll be uploading more content about other topics.
I guess that every 3 days I'll posting my advancements on the websites, but in the meantime, I will upload content from other languages.
