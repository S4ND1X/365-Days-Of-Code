#Day 65
Today I tried to make some advance with the Website, but I really don't know how to use CSS in React Components.
I wanted to create a Dropdown, but I don't know why it doesn't work.
I asked to some friends and one of them told me to use Bootstrap.
So, I don't know if I should learn how to use Bootstrap with React or keep doing it, with CSS and Html.
