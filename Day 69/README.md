#Day 69
Today I had to reinstall everything on my computer.
The good part is that it faster and I was able to clean all the system.
I started with a new project so I can have two main projects to upload.
I will try to make a Survival Game, right now I'm working on the player movement.
It's really fun because you can visualize much more what your code does
Tomorrow I'll be finishing the movement and start with the environment.
