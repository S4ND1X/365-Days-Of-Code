# Day 7

Today I finished this little main page, it was very nice to put in practice all the concepts that I have learned so far.
I really didn't have any problem but I will try to play a little bit with css to be able to understand it better.

I go back to school tomorrow! So I really don't know how much time I'll have but obviously I will keep posting every day.
Maybe I will make some post of what I be learning in classes or maybe trying to do other things rather than only html to keep me fresh.

But it's a fact that I will finish this challenge!
