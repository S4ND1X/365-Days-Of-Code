#Day 72
I came back to Unity to work on the player stats.
They were pretty fun to code, because when it is done, its super fun to play with them and find the right balance.
Also, they are pretty easy to code, you just need a general health and some value to subtract it every fixed time.
What I noticed is that my player movement, it is super bad, so I need to make it all over again from 0, because I added the stamina stats I need to add the run feature to the player but I made a horrible code in the player movement so I will try to do it from zero tomorrow.
What I'm planning is to finish at least the player movement, stats, and some kind of UI by the end of the week.
I'll upload a video from the project this Sunday.
