#Day 73
I spent the whole day finishing a school project, the deadline was today so I really needed to finish it.
I couldn't make any progress in my game, so I decided to do at least one Hackerrank problem.
The solution was very easy (thanks to the libraryâ€™s), the good part is that tomorrow I will have plenty of time so I will try to make the progress that I didn't did today.
