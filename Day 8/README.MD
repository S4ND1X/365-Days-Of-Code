# Day 8

Very late but I couldn't go to sleep without doing this!
I think that for a few months I'll be uploading all the content a little bit later than usual but I wont quit.

Today I made another little main page. Today's theme was "store". But I can cleary notice a more fluent way of making my html strcuture so it's amazing to know that with some more practice i can be more confident on what am i doing and in a few weeks at least know how to make a basic page without problems.

Tomorrow I will learn how to make a site responsive, so I'm very excited for what's to come!
