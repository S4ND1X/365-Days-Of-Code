#Day 85
Today I started studying OOP.
It is very fun to go back to Java, I had not used it for about 7 months.
I am learning to use This and in general remembering how to use Java.
What I did was, calculate the area of ​​a rectangle, but using OOP. I know it's very simple but I want the fundamentals to be clear so I do not have problems in the future.
