# Day 9

I almost didn't make but I did something. It is too late but at least I could make some advance.

Because I didn't have too much time left, I decided to make a little sorting algorithm and focus tomorrow in Html.

I made a bubble sort algorithm just to refresh some basic concepts in python, I mean there's not much more to say so let's wait for tomorrow
