#Day 90
Today I finally had more time to practice programming.
What I have been doing is, practice OOP but above all, composition, encapsulation and right now inheritance.
The truth is that the concept is not difficult, but it is very easy to confuse you. It is very easy to lose yourself among so many methods, but if you organize yourself, you will be able to do so.
