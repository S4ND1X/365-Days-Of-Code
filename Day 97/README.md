#Day 96

I started the final project of my programming class, originally what we were going to do, it was only to know how to manipulate files in Python but it was very simple. 
So I proposed another project and the teacher gave me permission to do it. What I will do will be like a game type in which the user can enter his age, his gender and a social class. 
And predict if I would survive the titanic accident, based on a dataset that I found, I will use machine learning through TensorFlow and several libraries that help you with the mathematical part. 
Today I could not make much progress mainly because I took a lot of time installing everything, I had to install anaconda, bookstores and others.
