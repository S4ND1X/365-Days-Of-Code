#Day 98

Today, basically, I dedicated myself to cleaning the csv in order to have only the necessary data to start training the algorithm. 
I changed the gender for a dummy variable, deleted several columns of irrelevant data and kept the same number of elements in all the columns. 
Tomorrow I will try to start doing the cross validation and divide the dataset, one part for training, another for validation and finally another for tests. 
I'm also learning React JS better, because next week, there will be two Hackathons so I have to be ready.
