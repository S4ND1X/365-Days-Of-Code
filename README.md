# 365-Days-Of-Code
I'll be posting ever single day what I learned and see how far I can go. Read More...

Hi! I'm so glad that you are reading this, that means that at least someone is sharing with my this journey and that is more than enough.

I want to challenge myself and see how far I can go and how much I can learn in one year. My main goal is that by the end of the year deserve to call me a SuperJr Developer. 

Right now i'm thinking to learn everything around **web developement** and later in the year I want to start learning more about other programming languajes. I want to learn **python** and all about algorithms or maybe start to introduce me in **Machine Learning**. 

I'm really excited to see what will happen this year and how far I can go.

**¡¡¡Let's get it!!!**
